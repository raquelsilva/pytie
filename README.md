My goal is to provide an opportunity for geoscientists to know all the steps required for 
seismic well tie and creation of a time depth-table. At the end, you can export an already 
formatted time-depth table to be imported into OpendTect free software.

### How to import functions:

    import pytie.functions as pytie
    
### Required packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- lasio
- las
- scipy
- math
- sys


**Documentation:**   
In the GitHub page you will find at the Wiki section the functions listed.
To access the notebook directly, please, follow the link below:

**Research:**    
Make your research **reproducible** by using open data and sharing your results with the community.
You can find open data in the following addresses:

[USGS (https://geology.cr.usgs.gov/energy/of00-200/WELLS/WELLIDX.HTM)](https://geology.cr.usgs.gov/energy/of00-200/WELLS/WELLIDX.HTM)

**Teaching:**    
With PyTie you can teach the basics of seismic processing/seismic well tie with real data. 
If you are interested in receiving additional material, please, join the google groups. There
is a jupiter notebook and one .las file used to test the functions. You will find there
all the explanations necessary to reproduce the results.
